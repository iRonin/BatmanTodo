# Batman.js + TodoMVC + Rails + Zeus + Guard

Simple project demonstrating how easy it is to connect [Batman.js](batmanjs.org) with Ruby on Rails backend.


UI has been borrowed from [TodoMVC Project](http://todomvc.com/) which uses different JS frameworks for implementation of a Todo app.

Projects includes [zeus](https://github.com/burke/zeus) which greatly increases Rails commands execution as well as is a replacement for Spork.
